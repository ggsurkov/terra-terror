-- THANK YOU for downloading Fexel's Spacious Spacebase asset pack. 

-- Before you get going designing all sorts of marvellous bases, there's a couple of details that's good to know.

-- 1) This asset pack takes up 4,423 objects and includes 72 networked ones (doors). So be aware of this. 
-- I recommend you design your base within a new folder, and deletes all unused parts of the assetpack 
-- to save on object count. 

-- 2) All parts in this pack is made to fit each other, but do not hesitate on adding your own decorations or parts. 
-- It took a while to get everything clean and well-fitted and you should find no issue combining the existing modules. 

-- 3) No functionality is included in this pack besides the doors. With functionality I mean code and nice things like that. 
-- Everything should be grouped rather neatly, so you'll have no issue adding your own if you want to. 

-- If you guys like this pack, I'm going to update it and add new parts and more intricate ones too. 
-- So if you like the style, if it was helpful to you, or in general a concept you'd like to see more of, hit that
-- "like" button in CC to let me know. 

-- Thank you so much - Fexelitche.
